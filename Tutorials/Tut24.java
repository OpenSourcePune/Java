//A rundown of comparisons 
//1.LinkedList element Insertion is faster than ArrayList
//2.LL deletion is faster that AL deletion
//3.AL search operations are faster than LL operations.
//4.LL has more memory overhead. In LL each node holds both
//data and address of next and previous node. AL consumes less memory.
